JR Data Scientist selective process at DHauz

--> Problem definition

You were hired by DHAUZ as a Data Scientist to analyze a database of customers from a telecom company.
Your task is to investigate data searching for insights that may help the company avoid churns. 
Also, you have to build a prective model that might foresee these churns, in a way that the company have time enough to employ a corrective action.

In this repository are attached the following files:
1) Directions for the technical test - in Portuguese (Desafio DHAUZ - Churn)
2) Modified database - created after the individual study of the variables (churn_challenge_data2.csv)
3) Script with Pre-processing and Exploratory analyses (prep_and_exp_DHAUZ.ipynb)
4) Script with Detailed analyses (detailed_DHAUZ.ipynb)
5) Analyses Report (churn_exp_report.pdf)
 
Main conclusions:
1) Customers tend to churn mainly between the sixth an the ninth month after hiring the service. There is another trend between 15 and 25 months, but it is lower.
2) Customers that call to Customer Care tend to churn.
3) The efficiency of the service (a rate between attempted and completed calls) does not have influence in the churn rate.
4) Churn rate is similar in different regions.
